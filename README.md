<hr>
Setup instructions:
<br>
First setup irevoshell [https://github.com/h921-corp/irevoshell] on a web server (has to be exposed to the internet). We recommend using a port different than 80 or 443.<br>
Then, compile revoshelld with pyinstaller or other, and get it onto the target system.<br>If you are looking for a file dropper, check out elysiandropper [https://github.com/h921-corp/elysiandropper].<br>
Rename the file to whatever you want. (We recommend using already existing processes, like csrss, lsass, svchost, iDWM, ...)<br>
